django-handstand-audreyr
========================

My personal mashup of:

* Base template using Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styling
* A core module with a BaseModel that provides created/modified times
* Custom simple profiles app
* Profile edit form, rendered with Bootstrap styles
* Registration via django-social-auth (Twitter & Facebook)
* Lazy profile shortcut that gives you a request.my_profile context variable
* django-debug-toolbar
* django-startcbv, to create quick working prototypes of whatever apps I need
* django-extensions, to give me shell_plus and whatever else comes with it

This is likely to be unstable, since it's meant for my own personal use.  Consider it sample code rather than using it outright.  Beware, parts of it could even be dangerous ;)
